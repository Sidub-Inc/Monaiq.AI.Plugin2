<output-context>
Provides to requesting context:
- diagnosis: { category: "setup" | "auth" | "validation" | "consumption", symptom, resolution, resolved: boolean }

This is a support entry point — users come here directly when something is broken.
</output-context>

<objective>
Diagnose and resolve Monaiq SDK integration issues. Self-diagnose first from available context (error messages, code, configuration), then fall back to interactive diagnostic questions if the category or resolution can't be determined autonomously. Reference the troubleshooting resource as the diagnostic knowledge source.
</objective>

<process>

## Prerequisites

Fetch the structured diagnostic decision trees for all 4 error categories:

Fetch `monaiq://troubleshooting` via the MCP `resources/read` operation or `fetch_step_resources` tool before proceeding.

When the user's SDK stack is known, also fetch the matching setup guide for cross-reference:

Fetch `monaiq://sdk/{stack}/setup` via the MCP `resources/read` operation or `fetch_step_resources` tool before proceeding.

Supported concrete setup resources are `monaiq://sdk/dotnet/setup`, `monaiq://sdk/node/setup`, and `monaiq://sdk/react/setup`.

## Step 1: Self-Diagnose

Attempt to determine the error category and specific symptom automatically from:
- Error messages in the conversation (stack traces, HTTP status codes, exception types)
- Code context (if the user shared code snippets or files)
- Configuration context (if appsettings.json, .env, or package.json is visible)

Map to one of the 4 categories:

| Category | Signals |
|----------|---------|
| **Installation and setup issues** | Package install errors, NuGet/npm failures, missing config sections, DI registration exceptions |
| **Connection and credential problems** | 401/403 responses, "API key" mentions, connection refused, credential errors |
| **License check failures** | License not found, expired, revoked, wrong product, unexpected entitlement values |
| **Usage tracking and purchase flow issues** | Consumption reporting failures, checkout session errors, redirect issues |

If a specific symptom is identified, proceed directly to the matching decision tree from the troubleshooting resource and follow its diagnostic steps to resolution.

## Step 2: Interactive Fallback

If the category cannot be determined automatically:
- Ask what the user is trying to do (install SDK, authenticate, validate license, report consumption, complete checkout)
- Ask for the specific error message or observed behavior
- Map responses to the appropriate error category and symptom

## Step 3: Apply Decision Tree

Using the matching decision tree from the troubleshooting resource:
1. Present the diagnostic steps from the resource
2. Work through each step with the user
3. Identify the root cause
4. Present the resolution

Reference the troubleshooting resource content — do not duplicate it. Use its decision trees directly.

## Step 4: Verify Resolution

After applying the resolution, confirm the issue is resolved:
- Ask the user to retry the operation
- If still failing, re-evaluate: check for a different root cause or escalate to a different error category

</process>

<success_criteria>
- The troubleshooting resource was fetched and used as the diagnostic knowledge base
- Self-diagnosis was attempted first from available error context
- Interactive fallback was used only if self-diagnosis was insufficient
- All 4 error categories are coverable (setup, auth, validation, consumption/checkout)
- Resolution was applied and verified
</success_criteria>
